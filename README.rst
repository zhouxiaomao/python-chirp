Install
=======

We only support python 3.5+

Dependencies
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   Alpine:       apk add python3-dev libffi-dev libressl-dev libuv-dev build-base
   Debian-based: apt install python3-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev libuv1-dev build-essential
   RPM-based:    yum install python3-devel libffi-devel openssl-devel libuv-devel gcc
   Arch:         pacman -S libffi openssl libuv
   OSX:          brew install libffi openssl libuv

As long as libchirp is beta we only provide wheels for Windows: building on
Windows is very complex.

If we have wheels for your platform, you don't need to install any dependencies.

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install libchirp

setup.py
--------

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install cffi
   python setup.py install

Contributing
============

Please open an issue first. Contributions of missing features are very welcome, but
we want to keep to scope of libchirp minimal, so additional features should
probably be implemented in an upper layer.

Most valuable contributions:

* Use it and report issues

* Fix documentation

* Promote libchirp

* Contribute any kind of tests or fuzzing (if possible hypothesis_ based)

* Make bindings for your favorite language

* Make packages for your favorite distribution

* A uvloop_ based implementation, see also issue_
